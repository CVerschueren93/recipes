EASY SPAGHETTI RECIPE

INGREDIENTS

12 ounces Any Spaghetti (uncooked)
15 ounces cans Tomato Sauce (low sodium)
2 tablespoons Olive Oil (extra virgin)
5 Large Garlic Cloves (minced)
2 ½ teaspoons Salt
add Black Pepper (ground)
2 teaspoons Oregano (dried)
add Parmesan Cheese (grated)
---------------------------------
METHOD

Cook spaghetti: Fill a large oven or pot with cold water 3/4 full and bring to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and spaghetti.

Ensure pasta does not stick together: Separate pasta with tongs a few times during the first 2 minutes of cooking to ensure it does not stick.
Keep cooking uncovered for 5 more minutes or until al dente, stirring occasionally.

Drain pasta: Test the spaghetti for doneness towards the end by grabbing one strand onto a plate with tongs. Do not overcook until too soft. The key to tasty pasta is cooked pasta with a bite. Drain in a colander.

Cook garlic: Return the pot to medium heat and add the olive oil, 4 garlic cloves, and oregano. Cook for 20 seconds, stirring constantly.
Garlic cooks fast and can easily burn, so don’t walk away. Turn off the heat.

Add remaining ingredients: Drained pasta, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 tsp salt, ground black pepper, and 1 more fresh garlic clove. Stir gently until warmed through.
That 1 clove of fresh garlic at the end is a must!

Sprinkle with Parmesan…and serve this spaghetti with tomato sauce immediately!
